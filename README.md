# linux-terminal-configs

This repo contains the configs for my terminal setup (terminal emulator, "fetch" tool and Bash prompt) across my different Linux machines.

**ℹ️ No, it's not empty. There is a branch for each one of my machines with their own tweaks to the configs (or complete different configs if I were using a different stack for a machine). The *main* branch will only have this README file.**

## 📂 Structure of the branches

For each application, tool, etc. that is used in the stack there is a folder.

In each folder reside the config files for said piece of the stack, already organized and structured so you only have to copy the contents of the folder and paste them in the home directory.

***This isn't the most elegant way to do it. I may have to change this in the future.***
